                <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Irsalia Orphan Nursery and Primary School, come to be as a result of a few widows came to inquiry about their unschooling orphan children.
                <br Many widows in the region are not able to enroll, their children in school due to financial instability.
                    As their point became clear I and my team started to think critically about the situation and how this was to be addressed.
                    However, everything in him (God) is not impossible as Apostle Dr. Luke mentioned in Luke 1:37.
                    And indeed, here is the school established in 2022 with 300 students, and today we have almost 600 students enrolled.
                    And we have about 10 teachers on our board who are very qualified to teach both primary and secondary school.
